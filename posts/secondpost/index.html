      <h1>Web Component Framework Breakdown.</h1>

<time datetime="2021-09-12">12 Sep 2021</time><a href="/tags/web-component/" class="post-tag">Web-Component</a><a href="/tags/javascript/" class="post-tag">JavaScript</a><a href="/tags/node/" class="post-tag">node</a>

<p>This week in my Web Components class, we looked into 4 popular Web Component Frameworks: Angular, React, StencilJS, and VueJS.  Each group member took one framework and followed the boilerplate/&quot;Hello World&quot; example to understand how projects in these frameworks are structured.  Below I will show the results of our research and testing as well as providing my personal opinions on a framework I would use.</p>
<p>Across all four frameworks, there were some similarities to the way they worked.  All four use JavaScript to create/define their components as well as the interactions with them.  Stencil JS does use TypeScript files however TypeScript is then translated to JavaScript.  The frameworks also have a similar file structure in a sense that each component is given it's own directory to be defined within the project.  What is in these directories varies by project.  Most use a JavaScript function and returns that return HTML but VueJS uses.Vue Files instead.  Lastly, all of these frameworks have a base index.html file which is where all the custom components are added to/called.</p>
<p>Based on looking at these frameworks, I think VueJS has the easiest development experience because it has the fewest amount of files out of all four frameworks.  I found when looking at the boilerplates for these frameworks, I easily understood where everything was in the VueJS directory.  I did not need to dig very far to find where the custom component was defined and what files interacted with it.  Since I have not used it to build anything, I don't know if can efficiently handle interactions like in other frameworks.  I have heard of React and Angular from my previous internships, but I have not heard of VueJS before.  This leads me to wonder how vast the development community is.</p>
<p>With a few finds from our research, I would probably work with React to build an application.  I know from personal experience that the react community is vast.  The JavaScript files declaring components looks like HTML and is easy to understand what the code does.  I also can easily follow the file structure of this project, there are more files than VueJS, but it is still easy to follow along.</p>
